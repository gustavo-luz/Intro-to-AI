# 🐍 AI-Powered Snake Game (MC906 - 1S2025 Unicamp)

This is an **AI-controlled Snake game** based on **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.

## 🔗 Forked From  
This project is forked from **[patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch)**.  
Original tutorial: **[Teach AI To Play Snake (YouTube) Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV)**

## 🎯 Objective
- The AI learns to **maximize the score** while avoiding collisions.
- The **neural network** predicts the best moves based on game state.

## 🧠 AI Implementation
- Uses **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.
- Game environment built with **Pygame**.
- Inspired by reinforcement learning tutorials.

## 🚀 How to Run

## Requirements
### Python & Virtual Environment
Ensure that Python is installed. The script has been tested with Python 3.11.7 and pip 23.2.1. Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies and prevent conflicts.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv snake_game_env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     snake_game_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source snake_game_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
