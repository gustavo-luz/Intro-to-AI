# üîç Search Algorithms in AI (MC906 - 1S2025 Unicamp)

This folder contains explanations and implementations of **search algorithms** used in AI.

## üóÇ Algorithms Covered
| Algorithm | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **BFS**  | Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. |
| **DFS**  | Exploring deep trees or graphs with limited memory. |
| **UCS**  | Finding the least-cost path in a weighted graph. |
| **IDS**  | Balancing memory usage and optimality in deep trees. |
| **Greedy Best-First Search**  | When a good heuristic is available and speed is more important than optimality. |
| **A***  | Finding the optimal path with a good heuristic. |

Soon: **Minimax** and **Genetic Algorithms** 

## üìå Usage
